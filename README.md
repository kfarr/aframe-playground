# aframe-playground

## what does this do?
This project has 2 goals:
* A place for me to experiment with different ways to get video playback to work in aframe projects on ios and android
* An example of a node.js / express / swig template "wrapper" for aframe projects that could be extended to include things like authentication, server logic, etc.

## how to use?
* clone and run `npm install`
* run `npm start`
* then load localhost:3000 in your browser
* you should see a list of projects

## Credits
* Some good aframe / webvr boilerplate code found here gtk2k.github.io
