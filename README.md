# aframe-theta-playground
    playing around with mozilla aframe mixed with the theta s camera
    
## what does this do?
you need to connect theta s camera to wifi
run npm start
then hit localhost:3000
the index page will prompt the theta s camera to take a still image
it will take ~10 seconds doing these things
the still image will then be visible in your browser
you can use the aframe built-in vr functionality to switch to you oculus or cardboard device
